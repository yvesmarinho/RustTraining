# Rust Training Books

Seven training courses covering Rust from different programming backgrounds, plus deep-dives on async, advanced patterns, and engineering practices.

This material combines original content with ideas and examples inspired by some of the best resources in the Rust ecosystem. The goal is to present an in-depth, technically accurate curriculum that weaves together knowledge scattered across books, blogs, conference talks, and video series into a cohesive, pedagogically structured experience.

> **Disclaimer:** These books are training material, not an authoritative reference. While we strive for accuracy, always verify critical details against the [official Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/) and the [Rust Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/).

### Inspirations & Acknowledgments

- [**The Rust Programming Language**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) — the foundation everything builds on
- [**Jon Gjengset**](https://www.youtube.com/c/JonGjengset) — deep-dive streams on advanced Rust internals, `Crust of Rust` series
- [**withoutboats**](https://without.boats/blog/) — async design, `Pin`, and the futures model
- [**fasterthanlime (Amos)**](https://fasterthanli.me/) — systems programming from first principles, engaging long-form explorations
- [**Mara Bos**](https://marabos.nl/) — *Rust Atomics and Locks*, concurrency primitives
- [**Aleksey Kladov (matklad)**](https://matklad.github.io/) — Rust analyzer insights, API design, error handling patterns
- [**Niko Matsakis**](https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/) — language design, borrow checker internals, Polonius
- [**Rust by Example**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) and [**Rustonomicon**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/) — practical patterns and unsafe deep-dives
- [**This Week in Rust**](https://this-week-in-rust.org/) — community discoveries that shaped many examples
- [**Binary Musings - Tag(Rust)**](https://binarymusings.org/posts/category/rust/) — Deep dive into Rust internals 
- …and many others in the **Rust community at large** whose blog posts, conference talks, RFCs, and forum discussions have informed this material — too numerous to list individually, but deeply appreciated

## 🔧 For Maintainers

<details>
<summary>Building, serving, and editing the books locally</summary>

### Prerequisites

Install [Rust via **rustup**](https://rustup.rs/) if you haven't already, then:

```bash
cargo install mdbook@0.4.52 mdbook-mermaid@0.14.0
```

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/RustTraining.git
cd RustTraining
```

### Build & serve

```bash
cargo xtask build               # Build all books into site/ (local preview)
cargo xtask serve               # Build and serve at http://localhost:3000
cargo xtask deploy              # Build all books into docs/ (for GitHub Pages)
cargo xtask clean               # Remove site/ and docs/
```

To build or serve a single book:

```bash
cd c-cpp-book && mdbook serve --open    # http://localhost:3000
```

### Deployment

The site auto-deploys to GitHub Pages on push to `main` via `.github/workflows/pages.yml`. No manual steps needed.
